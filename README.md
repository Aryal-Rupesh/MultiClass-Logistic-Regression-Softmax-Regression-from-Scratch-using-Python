This project implements Multiclass Logistic Regression (also known as Softmax Regression) from scratch using Python, without relying on machine learning libraries like scikit-learn. Gradient descent is used for optimization. The code is designed to be simple, efficient, and easy to understand, making it a great resource for anyone looking to understand the mathematical foundations and implementation details of Softmax Regression.
